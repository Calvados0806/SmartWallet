## About
***
This python script was created to control costs. There are some flags using in this script:

`--supply n` - supply score

`--history [n]` - show history of last n purchases

`--discard n message` - set purchase (point how much money was spent and for what)

For example:

`$ python3 wallet.py --history 3` - show 3 last purchases
